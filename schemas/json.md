# JSON output

What a command prints with `--json`. Reference: adr-20261015-a-read-is-one-json-envelope.
Written by `scripts/lib/json.sh`, the one place Jig writes JSON, in shell and without `jq`
(ADR-0002). The contract tests are `tests/json.t.sh` (the envelope) and the `--json` tests of
each command's own test file (its `data`).

## The envelope

Every `--json` read prints exactly one line on stdout, whether it succeeded or was refused:

```json
{"schema":1,"revision":null,"generated_at":"2026-10-15T12:00:00Z","data":{...}}
{"schema":1,"revision":null,"generated_at":"2026-10-15T12:00:00Z","error":{"code":"failed","message":"task list: invalid status: bogus"}}
```

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `schema` | `1`. Raised only on an incompatible change: a field removed, renamed or given another type. Adding a field is compatible and does not raise it, so a consumer ignores fields it does not know |
| `revision` | the clone's revision, which a consumer compares between reads and sends back with a write. **`null` until the per-clone counter exists** (task `clone-revision`): unknown, never "unchanged" |
| `generated_at` | when the read started, UTC, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` |
| `data` | the command's answer, its shape below. Present only on success |
| `error` | instead of `data` when the command refused or failed: `code` and `message`, both strings. `message` is what the command printed after `jig: error:` (possibly several lines, joined by `\n`), or `exited with status <n>` when it said nothing. `code` is `failed` for every refusal until stable failure codes exist (task `failure-codes`) |

The exit status is the command's: 0 with `data`, non-zero with `error`. What the command says to a
person — warnings, notices — goes to stderr unchanged and never into the envelope. Reading never
touches the network: no forge CLI, no fetch.

Strings escape `"`, `\` and every control byte (`\n`, `\t`, `\r`, the rest as `\u00XX`); other
bytes pass through as they are, so a value is UTF-8 when what Jig read was. A value Jig has no
fact for is `null`, never an empty string or a missing key.

## `jig task list --json`

The tasks `jig task list` would show with the same arguments: live ones by default, every task with
`--all`, one status with `--status <s>`. `--json` may stand anywhere among them; `--goals` changes
nothing, since the goal is always in the data.

```json
{
  "tasks": [ <task>, ... ],
  "hidden": 4,
  "housekeeping": {"ran_at": "2026-10-15T09:00:00Z", "forge": "github"}
}
```

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `tasks` | one object per task, sorted by id |
| `hidden` | how many finished tasks (`consolidated`, `abandoned`) the selection left out; `0` with `--all` or `--status` |
| `housekeeping` | the last `jig housekeeping` run the flags below come from: `ran_at` (UTC) and `forge` (`github`, `gitlab`, `none`, `failed`, or `null` for a log older than the field); `null` when housekeeping never ran in this checkout |

A task:

| Field | Type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | the task id |
| `class` | string or null | `T0`–`T4`; `null` while unclassified |
| `status` | string | `active`, `ready`, `consolidated`, `abandoned` (schemas/state.md) |
| `issue` | string or null | the tracker issue the id starts with |
| `goal` | string or null | the first paragraph under `## Goal` in `task.md`, joined into one line |
| `knowledge_consolidated` | boolean | the knowledge decision is recorded |
| `paused` | boolean | |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | string or null | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `branch` | string or null | `null`: the task has not been started |
| `base_branch` | string | the branch the task is judged against and lands on (`jig_task_base`): its recorded base, else `git.base_branch` |
| `worktree` | object or null | `{"path", "uncommitted"}`: the worktree, other than the checkout the command ran in, that has the task's branch checked out, and how many files there differ from its HEAD |
| `gate` | object or null | a T3/T4 design's gate: `{"state", "by"}`, `state` `waiting`, `changed` (the design moved after approval) or `approved`; `by` `human` or `agent`, `null` while waiting. `null` for any other class, or before `design.md` exists |
| `autopilot` | object or null | the task's autopilot run: `state` (`on`, `stopped`, `done`), `mode` (`attended`, `unattended`), `repairs` (integer), `stage` and `stage_at` (the last stage the current run entered), `stop_reason` and `stop_at` (the journal's last stop), `phase` (`<spec-id>/<n>` for a task of a phase run); each `null` when there is none. `null` when the task never ran on autopilot |
| `pull_request` | object or null | `{"url"}` of the pull request `jig task ship` opened. Its state and CI are not read from the forge here; they join this object from a local cache (task `forge-cache`) |
| `housekeeping_flags` | array of strings | the flags of the last housekeeping run that still stand for the task — `needs-consolidation`, `wrong-base`, `abandoned?`, `worktree-kept`, `base-unreleased`, `STALE_CANDIDATE` — after the same local recheck the status page makes (a closed task is no longer `needs-consolidation`); `[]` for none |
