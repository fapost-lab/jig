# Tools come from the project's own environment only (adr-20260918-profiles-narrow-per-check-with-project-tools): phpunit,
# pest, phpstan and pint are read from vendor/bin/ and nowhere else — a
# global install would check the project with another version and other
# rules. composer is the stack's own toolchain and comes from PATH.
#
# Narrowing (ADR-0041, adr-20260918-profiles-narrow-per-check-with-project-tools), per check: phpstan and pint each lint the
# changed .php files; phpstan runs in full when its own configuration
# changed. phpunit/pest run the test files the changed paths map to — a
# changed *Test.php itself, or any FooTest.php under tests/ for a changed
# Foo.php — and everything when a path maps to nothing or a file that can
# affect any test (composer.json/lock, phpunit.xml*) changed. composer
# validate is not narrowable by files: in a scoped run it runs only when
# composer.json or composer.lock changed, and skips with a reason otherwise;
# in a full run it always runs.
#
# The test rule is not "anything that is not .php needs no test". What decides
# is whether a path can change the result of the test run, which runs PHP: a
# front-end source is neither bundled nor served by it, while the build that
# produces the assets a browser test loads is a different matter and keeps the
# full set. The two lists below draw that line; what neither describes still
# runs everything, so an unrecognised path costs time rather than coverage
# (ADR-0013).
