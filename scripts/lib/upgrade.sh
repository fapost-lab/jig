# happened to run another command — the reported case was a run that printed
# "55 placed, 49 kept, 2 removed; manifest updated" and left
# `.ai/templates/AGENTS.md` unplaced, found a day later in `jig doctor` as
# "1 pending item(s) although the version is the same".
#
# It runs the project's own dispatcher as a subprocess, and that is the point,
# not an implementation detail: an upgrade is carried out by the code of the
# version being replaced. The run that left that template behind was 0.15.1
# doing the work, and 0.15.1 does not stage `.ai/templates/AGENTS.md` at all —
# the line that copies it arrived in 0.16.0. Worse, the template was in the
# manifest and not in its stage, so the old code deleted it. Asking
# `upgrade_pending` in this process would ask the old decision table, which is
# satisfied by construction: it would stay silent in exactly the case this
# check exists for. Only the newly installed code knows what it wants.
#
# Never on a dry run — `status`, `verify` and `doctor` each run one on every
# invocation (ADR-0017), and a self-check there would double their cost and
# recurse. A real upgrade pays one extra dry run (0.78 s against 0.88 s for the
# run itself, on 97 files), for a command that runs once per release.
#
# It never fails the upgrade it follows: that upgrade already happened, and a
# check that cannot answer says so instead of turning a success into an error

# docs/upgrading.mdx#from-015-to-016); nothing is printed once <from> is
# 0.16.0 or newer.
#
# The first has a real predicate — jig_section_report_state, the same one
# `jig doctor`'s instructions check reads, so the two can never disagree
# about it (doctor.sh's own comment says so) — and is skipped once satisfied.
# `jig doctor` is where it can be checked again later; nothing new needed
# there.
#
# The other two are advisory text, not a tracked done/not-done step:
#
#   - Whether the project's verification tools are installed cannot be
#     answered here without running them, which is exactly what `jig verify`
#     exists to do, on its own busy-record and narrowing
#     (adr-20260925-one-test-run-per-clone-and-a-dead-run-is-not-a-pass). Its
#     own exit code (0 or 3) is the predicate; running it as a side effect of
#     every upgrade would mean paying for a full run here or contending with
#     one already in flight. Always shown, unconditionally, once <from>
#     predates 0.16.0.
#   - Whether a self-written profile needs `verifies: nothing` has no correct
#     yes/no answer from the filesystem alone: a custom profile with real
#     checks correctly has no `verifies` key, and nothing distinguishes that
#     from one with none short of running its checks and reading why they
#     skipped. Per this task's own rule, a step with no predicate is not
#     filed as one; this stays a named pointer at whichever custom profiles
#     the project actually has, so a project with none sees nothing.

# upgrade_pending — the pending action lines ("install <rel>", "link <rel>"
# or "replace <rel>") that `jig upgrade` would apply right now, for whichever
# project/config the caller is already running against. Read-only: never
# mutates the project. Built on top of --dry-run rather than duplicating the
# staging/decision-table logic — `cmd_upgrade --dry-run` already computes
# exactly this, and command substitution already runs it in a subshell, so
# its own exit cleanup (common.sh) and locals never touch the caller's.
#
# Callers: `jig status` (drift's pending count) and `jig verify` (refuse to
# run on a stale install). Precondition: the project is initialised
# (jig_require_init already satisfied by the caller — cmd_upgrade re-checks
# it regardless).
#
# Output/exit contract:
#   0  success; zero or more pending lines printed on stdout, one per line,
#      each exactly one of cmd_upgrade's own "install "/"link "/"replace "

#      by the filter below — they are informational, not pending per-path
#      actions.
#   3  pending state is unknown right now and nothing is printed. This is
#      the expected outcome whenever the underlying dry run cannot complete
#      at all — most notably when the framework source root cannot be
#      determined (e.g. a copy-mode install whose source checkout was since
#      deleted, domains/install). Any other cmd_upgrade failure (a corrupt
#      .ai/config.yaml, say) also lands here rather than aborting the
#      caller: a best-effort staleness check must never itself turn into a
