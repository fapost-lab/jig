# from disk with the network off, and it follows the reader's light or dark
# preference. It
# answers, in this order, what needs the reader, what is running, how far the
# specifications are, and then everything `jig status` prints.
#
# It stays current without a server: the commands that change a task, a spec
# or a housekeeping result redraw it (jig_status_page_touch, common.sh), and
# the open page reloads itself every 10 seconds. The script does the reloading
# (adr-20260924-the-status-page-keeps-the-readers-place): it waits while the
# reader is busy, keeps their scroll position and open <details> across the
# reload in sessionStorage, and offers a pause. Without JavaScript the
# `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` in <noscript> reloads it as before. One page
# per clone, in the main checkout: the page belongs to the checkout that owns
# the workspaces, and a worktree hands every mode to the main checkout's own
# jig (`_status_page`, below).
#
# Everything on it is an answer this report already consumes — the same
# helpers the text report and the completion gates call — and every value is
# escaped with _status_h, because task ids, reasons, finding locations, spec
# titles and paths are text people wrote.
