# The forge cache: what housekeeping last heard from the forge about pull
# requests, kept so that a read never asks the forge itself
# (adr-20261015-a-read-is-one-json-envelope; schemas/json.md). Written by
# `jig housekeeping` from the list it already fetches, which replaces it whole;
# `jig upgrade` adds the one pull request it has just opened (forgecache_record),
# so the upgrade waiting for its merge is known before housekeeping next runs
# (adr-20261029-an-upgrade-pull-request-is-landed-by-jig). Read by
# `jig task list --json` and `jig status`.
#
#   .ai/runtime/forge-cache, one line per pull request, newest first as the
#   forge listed them:
#     <head><TAB><base><TAB><state><TAB><ci><TAB><fetched_at><TAB><head-commit><TAB><url><TAB><mergeable><TAB><review><TAB><waiting_for>
#   <state> open|merged|closed; <ci> green|red|pending|none, `-` when it was
#   not asked (a pull request that is not open, a forge that does not list it);
#   <fetched_at> UTC, when the forge said so; <head-commit> and <url> the pull
#   request's head and address, `-` when the forge did not say; <mergeable>
#   conflicting|mergeable for an open pull request the forge judged against
#   its base, `-` otherwise (read by the staging drift report,
#   jig_staging_drift); <review> approved|changes|waiting|none for an open pull
#   request whose review the forge was asked about (jig_pr_approval_v's words,
#   adr-20261113-reviewers-are-read-from-the-forge), `-` otherwise and when it
#   could not say; <waiting_for> who is still requested as a reviewer, logins
#   comma-separated, `-` when nobody or not known. A line written before a column existed ends before it
#   and reads as if each missing one were `-`. Lines starting with `#` are
#   comments.
